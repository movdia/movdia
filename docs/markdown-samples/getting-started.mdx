# Getting Started with LeadFlow

This guide walks you through the initial setup of LeadFlow, a performance marketing platform for routing leads, tracking calls, and analyzing campaign performance. By the end, you will have a configured campaign with call tracking and a connected publisher, ready to receive live traffic.

**Estimated time**: 15 minutes

**Audience**: New platform users, marketing managers, and account administrators.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, confirm the following:

| Requirement         | Details                                                |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Account credentials | Email and temporary password from your account manager |
| Browser             | Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 15+, or Edge 90+      |
| Access level        | Admin or Campaign Manager role                         |
| Tracking numbers    | At least one local or toll-free number provisioned     |

:::info First-Time Login
Your account manager sends credentials via email after contract activation. Check your spam folder if you have not received them within 24 hours.
:::

## Step 1: Log In and Complete Initial Setup

Navigate to `https://app.leadflow.example.com` and sign in with your credentials. You will be prompted to change your password on first login.

After authentication, complete the initial setup wizard:

1. **Company profile** — Enter your company name, industry vertical, and billing address.
2. **Timezone** — Select your primary timezone. All reporting timestamps and campaign schedules use this setting.
3. **Notification preferences** — Choose which alerts you want to receive (lead cap warnings, campaign paused, daily summary) and delivery channels (email, SMS, or in-app).

:::tip Timezone Matters
Lead timestamps, scheduled reports, and campaign day-parting rules all depend on your timezone setting. If your team spans multiple timezones, select the one your reporting stakeholders use.
:::

Click **Complete Setup** to save. You can update these settings later under **Settings > Company Profile**.

## Step 2: Configure Your First Campaign

Campaigns are the core organizational unit in LeadFlow. Each campaign defines how leads are accepted, scored, routed, and billed.

1. Navigate to **Campaigns > Create New Campaign**.
2. Enter a campaign name and select the vertical (e.g., Insurance, Home Services, Education).
3. Configure lead routing rules:

| Routing Mode    | Description                                                  |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Round-robin     | Distributes leads equally across all active buyers           |
| Weighted        | Assigns leads proportionally based on buyer weight (1-100)   |
| Priority        | Routes to the highest-priority buyer first; falls through on rejection |
| Ping-post       | Sends anonymized lead data to buyers for real-time bidding   |

4. Set campaign parameters:

```
Bid floor:          $8.00
Daily lead cap:     500
Duplicate window:   30 days
Accepted states:    CA, TX, FL, NY
Hours of operation: Mon-Fri, 8:00 AM - 8:00 PM (campaign timezone)
```

5. Click **Save and Activate** or **Save as Draft** to finalize later.

:::caution Bid Floor and Caps
Setting the bid floor too high may reduce fill rate. Setting the daily cap too low may cause the campaign to pause before peak traffic hours. Monitor the first 48 hours and adjust based on actual volume.
:::

## Step 3: Set Up Call Tracking

LeadFlow tracks inbound calls by assigning unique tracking numbers to each traffic source.

### Create a Tracking Number Pool

1. Go to **Call Tracking > Number Pools > Create Pool**.
2. Select the number type:
   - **Local** — Area-code-specific numbers for regional campaigns
   - **Toll-free** — 800/888 numbers for national campaigns
3. Set the pool size (minimum 5 numbers for web session tracking).
4. Assign the pool to a campaign.

### Configure IVR Flow

Set up an Interactive Voice Response flow to qualify callers before routing:

1. Navigate to **Call Tracking > IVR Builder**.
2. Build the flow using drag-and-drop blocks:

```
Greeting          "Thank you for calling. Press 1 for sales, 2 for support."
  |
  +-- [1] Sales
  |     |
  |     Filter     Caller state in [CA, TX, FL, NY]?
  |       |
  |       +-- Yes --> Route to buyer queue
  |       +-- No  --> Play message: "We do not service your area."
  |
  +-- [2] Support
        |
        Route to support queue
```

3. Enable **call recording** (requires caller consent notice — configurable in IVR settings).
4. Optionally add a **whisper message** that plays for the agent before connecting: *"Lead from Google Ads, Los Angeles, auto insurance."*

### Verify Your Setup

Dial one of your tracking numbers from a mobile phone. You should hear the IVR greeting and be routed according to your flow. Check **Call Tracking > Recent Calls** to confirm the call was logged with the correct campaign attribution.

## Step 4: Connect a Publisher

Publishers are traffic sources that submit leads to your campaigns.

1. Go to **Publishers > Add Publisher**.
2. Enter the publisher name and contact email.
3. LeadFlow generates a unique **posting URL** and **API key**:

```
POST https://api.leadflow.example.com/leads/submit
Authorization: Bearer pub_k8f2a9c1...

{
  "campaign_id": "camp_ins_auto_ca",
  "first_name": "Jane",
  "last_name": "Doe",
  "email": "jane.doe@example.com",
  "phone": "+14155551234",
  "state": "CA",
  "zip": "90210",
  "insurance_type": "auto",
  "consent_timestamp": "2026-02-21T10:30:00Z",
  "consent_text": "I agree to be contacted..."
}
```

4. Set acceptance criteria:
   - Required fields (first name, last name, phone, state, consent)
   - Field validation rules (valid phone format, valid state code)
   - Duplicate check window (e.g., reject if same phone submitted within 30 days)

5. Configure payout rules:
   - Fixed payout per accepted lead, or
   - Revenue share based on buyer bid

6. Send the publisher their posting URL, API key, and the field specification document.

:::info Testing Before Go-Live
Enable **Test Mode** on the publisher profile to submit leads without affecting billing or live routing. Test leads appear in **Publishers > Test Logs** with full validation results.
:::

## Step 5: Review Your Dashboard

After your campaign receives its first leads, the dashboard populates with real-time metrics.

Navigate to **Dashboard** to view:

| Metric           | Description                                                |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Lead volume      | Total leads submitted, accepted, and rejected (today/MTD)  |
| Conversion rate  | Percentage of submitted leads accepted by buyers           |
| Revenue          | Total earnings from accepted leads (bid amount * volume)   |
| Call duration     | Average and total call duration for tracked calls          |
| Top publishers   | Ranked by volume and acceptance rate                       |
| Top buyers       | Ranked by fill rate and average bid                        |

**Filters available**: Date range, campaign, publisher, buyer, state, lead status.

**Export**: Click the export icon on any report to download CSV. Scheduled exports (daily/weekly) are configurable under **Reports > Scheduled Exports**.

## Troubleshooting

### Leads Are Not Routing to Buyers

**Symptom**: Leads appear as "Accepted" but show "No Buyer Match" in the routing log.

**Check**:
1. Verify at least one buyer is active and has available daily cap.
2. Confirm the buyer's geographic and vertical filters match the incoming lead data.
3. Check **Campaigns > Routing Logs** for rejection reasons.

### Call Tracking Number Does Not Ring

**Symptom**: Dialing a tracking number results in silence or a fast busy signal.

**Check**:
1. Confirm the number pool is assigned to an active campaign.
2. Verify the IVR flow has a valid routing destination (not an empty node).
3. Check **Call Tracking > Number Status** — numbers in "Provisioning" state are not yet active.

### Dashboard Shows No Data

**Symptom**: Dashboard widgets display "No data available" despite active campaigns.

**Check**:
1. Confirm the date range filter includes today.
2. Verify leads were submitted via the API and not only through Test Mode (test leads do not appear on the main dashboard).
3. Allow up to 5 minutes for data to propagate to the dashboard after the first lead submission.

### Publisher Posts Are Rejected

**Symptom**: Publisher receives `400 VALIDATION_ERROR` responses.

**Check**:
1. Review the error response body — it lists which fields failed validation.
2. Confirm the publisher is sending all required fields.
3. Verify the `consent_timestamp` is in ISO 8601 format and within the last 90 days.
4. Check that the API key is active under **Publishers > API Keys**.
