# Writing Samples

This section contains documentation samples that demonstrate the types of content I produce professionally. Each sample is built in Docusaurus using MDX, reflecting both writing skill and proficiency with docs-as-code tooling.

The samples use fictional product names but are grounded in real domains I have worked in: data catalog APIs, performance marketing platforms, and documentation infrastructure.

## What You Will Find Here

### API Reference Documentation

A REST API reference for a fictional data catalog platform (CatalogHub), demonstrating endpoint documentation with OAuth authentication, request/response schemas, search and SQL query APIs, error handling, and SDK quick-start examples. Inspired by my work documenting data.world's 100+ endpoint API surface.

### Support and Onboarding Guide

A getting-started guide for a fictional performance marketing platform (LeadFlow), demonstrating onboarding documentation with step-by-step campaign setup, call tracking configuration, publisher integration, and troubleshooting. Inspired by my work at Phonexa and AMO writing knowledge base content.

### Technical Migration Guide

A documentation platform migration guide covering the end-to-end process of moving API docs from a hosted portal to a docs-as-code workflow. Covers discovery, OpenAPI spec conversion, CI/CD pipeline setup, and cutover planning. Inspired by my work leading the Stoplight-to-ReadMe migration at data.world.
