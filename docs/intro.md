# Writing Samples

Welcome to my documentation portfolio. This section contains real examples of the types of documentation I produce, built directly in Docusaurus to demonstrate both my writing skills and my proficiency with static site generators.

## What You'll Find Here

Each sample demonstrates a different documentation type commonly needed in software organizations:

### API Documentation

Complete REST API reference documentation with endpoint descriptions, request/response schemas, authentication details, and error handling guides. This demonstrates the ability to document developer-facing interfaces clearly and thoroughly.

### Markdown Documentation

A getting-started guide showcasing structured onboarding documentation. This demonstrates the ability to take a new user from zero to productive with clear prerequisites, step-by-step instructions, and verification steps.

### Technical Guides

A production deployment guide covering infrastructure, configuration, monitoring, and troubleshooting. This demonstrates the ability to document complex operational procedures for DevOps and engineering teams.

All samples are written in MDX and rendered by Docusaurus — the same tools used in production documentation workflows. The source files are available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/movdia/movdia/tree/master/docs).
