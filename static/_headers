  Security headers for platforms that support _headers files
  (Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, etc.)

  Note: GitHub Pages does not support custom HTTP headers natively.
  These are included to demonstrate knowledge and for future portability.
  The site uses meta-tag equivalents via a custom Docusaurus plugin for
  security policies that can be expressed as meta tags.

  For full HTTP-level security headers, consider deploying behind
  Cloudflare (free tier) or using a platform that supports _headers.
